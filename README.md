# Iris_Classification
The "Hello World" project of machine learning world.

In this project, the famous Iris dataset is used.The dataset basically contains measurements 
of sepal and petal dimensions of 3 species of flower.

I have tried to classify the species based on the features provided,by using two state-of-the-art
ML algorithms - Support Vector Machine and K - Nearest Neighbours.

Both the classifiers do excellent and the classification details are included in the notebooks.

Detailed analysis is pretty much restricted by the size of the dataset.However, it gives pretty
good idea of the implementation, working and accuracy of the models.
